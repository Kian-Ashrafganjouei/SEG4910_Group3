# Travel-Buddy (Capstone-Project)

A platform designed for travelers who want to connect with others for companionship or support during their trips.
Whether theyâ€™re looking for a travel buddy to explore a destination together or need local assistance when they arrive (such as a local guide or someone to show them around). It makes traveling safer, more social, and more enjoyable.
It focuses on connecting like-minded people with shared interests or offering help from locals for a smoother travel experience.


The goal of this project is to design and build a complete software solution that will concretize the aforementioned idea.
