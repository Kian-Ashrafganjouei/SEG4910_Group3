# Travel-Buddy (Capstone-Project)

A platform designed for travelers who want to connect with others for companionship or support during their trips.
Whether theyâ€™re looking for a travel buddy to explore a destination together or need local assistance when they arrive (such as a local guide or someone to show them around). It makes traveling safer, more social, and more enjoyable.
It focuses on connecting like-minded people with shared interests or offering help from locals for a smoother travel experience.


The goal of this project is to design and build a complete software solution that will concretize the aforementioned idea.

## Roles
This first draft of the project roles is as follows:

- Project manager [Jazia Djoudad]

- Business analyst [Isam Karroum]

- QA manager [Lisa Korolyov - Kian Ashrafganjouei]

- Architect [Hossein Hajmirbaba]

- Build manager [Ghait Ouled Amar Ben Cheikh]

- Lead developers [Hossein Hajmirbaba - Lisa Korolyov - Kian Ashrafganjouei]


Note that these roles are subject to change. The final roles will be established once we have a clear architecture document describing the technical requirements.

## Objectives
### Benefit to Customer:
- For travelers: The platform will help users find companions, reducing the risks associated with solo travel, making the journey more enjoyable, and enhancing the experience of discovering new places with like-minded people.
- For locals: It offers opportunities to become guides and provide services, boosting local tourism and economy.

### Key Accomplishments:
- User-friendly interface for travelers to create profiles, search for travel buddies or local guides, and initiate connections.
- Secure messaging system to allow travelers and locals to communicate safely before and during trips.
- Reliable user authentication and profile verification system to ensure safety.

### Criteria for Success:
- A functional, user-friendly platform where users can easily find travel companions or local guides.
- Meeting development milestones, including successful deployment and bug-free operation of major features like user matching, messaging, and profile management.

## Expected Architecture
- **Frontend**: Angular with Bootstrap for UI.
- **Backend**: Spring Boot for REST APIs, Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MySQL.
- **Messaging**: WebSocket integration for real-time communication (Spring Boot can handle this easily).
- **Third-party APIs**: Google Maps API, Stripe (if payments are needed in later stages).

*Note that these are subject to change.*

## Anticipated Risks
- Developing a robust matching algorithm that efficiently pairs travelers with compatible buddies or locals based on preferences, location, and schedule.
- Ensuring user data privacy and platform security, especially for profile verification and messaging systems.
- Managing performance and scalability of the platform as it grows, especially with real-time messaging and location services.

## Legal and Social Issues
- **Legal**: Ensuring compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR) since the platform will collect sensitive user data such as personal information, location, and possibly payment details.
- **Social**: Safeguarding user interactions, particularly concerning trust and safety during offline meetups. Proper mechanisms like user reviews and verification will be essential to create a secure environment.

## Initial Plans for First Release
### First Semester:
- Requirements analysis and project definition.
- UI/UX mockups and wireframes.
- Development of core features for the minimum viable product (MVP), including user authentication, profile creation, and search functionality.
- Basic matching algorithm for travel buddies and local guides.
- Presentation of the first running system with initial feedback from customers.

### Second Semester:
- Completion of the full platform with additional features such as messaging, reviews, and profile verification.
- Refining the matching algorithm based on initial user feedback.
- Usability testing and implementation of improvements.
- Beta release of the platform with real user testing.
- Final report and evaluation, including lessons learned, customer satisfaction feedback, and future expansion opportunities.
