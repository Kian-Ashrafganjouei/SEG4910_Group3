Project Overview
A platform designed for travelers who want to connect with others for companionship or support during their trips. Whether they’re looking for a travel buddy to explore a destination together or need local assistance when they arrive (such as a local guide or someone to show them around). It makes traveling safer, more social, and more enjoyable. It focuses on connecting like-minded people with shared interests or offering help from locals for a smoother travel experience.

Our platform serves as a digital bridge, connecting travelers from around the world based on their destination cities and, optionally, their cities of origin. At its core, we addresses two primary needs in the travel community:

Companion Matching: For those seeking a travel buddy, our platform pairs users heading to the same destination. Whether you're looking for someone to share adventures with, split costs, or simply enjoy companionship during your journey, our software helps you find your ideal travel partner.

Local Expertise: For travelers seeking authentic local experiences, our platform connects visitors with residents or experienced travelers in their destination city. This feature provides invaluable local insights, personalized recommendations, and potential meetups for a more immersive travel experience.

Questions for the Client
What is the primary target audience for this platform (e.g., age range, solo travelers, group travelers)?
Are there specific regions or countries you want to focus on initially?
Do you want to incorporate any monetization features (e.g., premium memberships, commission from local guide bookings)?
How do you envision the verification process for users to ensure safety and trust?
Are there any specific features you consider essential that haven't been mentioned?
How do you plan to market and grow the user base for this platform?
Do you want to integrate with any existing travel services or APIs (e.g., booking platforms, travel information)?
What are your expectations for the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and timeline for launch?
What should we name our platform?


Meeting number 1 notes:
Customer recommends to start with searching by destinations only for now
Find people and destinations
Suggested filters to add: gender, country of origin
Customer recommends to design iteratively so that adding on to product is easier later on
We should focus on demonstrating feasibility right now
Possible next steps:
Search social media to tell me who a potential travel buddy is
Travel buddy reviews
Find people for entire trips and plan out transportation in app (not just for meeting up at the destination, but for traveling between destinations together)
Season-sensitive tips: ex. If someone wants to visit a lake to swim, notify user if it may be frozen at the time of the trip
Game-ify 
Regarding using other apps for communication between travel buddies: 
it’s good to use other apps to avoid responsibility and cost, but we lose the analytics part
Regarding using open-source components:
Make sure to cite/refer 
Make sure ok to use commercially, not just for personal use (if applicable)
The more reused components we use, the more we will need to deliver to impress people
Regarding using our own authentication system:
Make sure customer data is not being exposed
Regarding matching/suggesting people as travel buddies:
Comment-like structure under trip posts for manual selection:
What happens when many users? - need to read through thousands of comments to find a buddy? Conversation threads can be very long
Long comment thread makes it hard to find people
Maybe use AI or text mining (ex. Amy commented on your trips involving hiking - suggest Amy as travel buddy)
Keep comment threads forever? Until trip is over? Until trip deleted? Have an expiry date?
Travel buddy suggestions
Maybe based on preset preferences in your profile? Instead of filtering every time
Review other trips
“I liked X, but would have preferred to leave out activity Y”
Transient profile, not corporal profile
Perhaps we can differentiate things that a user is always interested in versus only occasionally 
Customer recommends writing down all ‘crazy’ ideas, keeping them in the backlog, and going through them once in a while
Other recommendations:
Consider CI/CD pipeline
By mid December have at least 80% of product done
Prioritize the requirements
Even if we encounter bugs, continue to implement the core of the product (don’t focus on making every little detail perfect for now)
Consider a release branch
Architecture? (mentioned onion architecture)
Present something incomplete rather than postpone a client demo meeting
Design documents


Next steps: 
Set up jira board
Plan sprints
Think about what we need from the client
Set up github for communicating with the client
Action Items
Participants to continue brainstorming and refining the platform's requirements.
Create a collaboration space for ongoing communication and updates.
Prioritize foundational infrastructure and finalize initial requirements.
Present any progress or outstanding issues promptly in future meetings.
Explore and finalize the authentication mechanism, considering third-party options like Gmail.
Initiate sprint planning utilizing a Kanban or Scrum board and collaborate efficiently using tools like Jira.
Key Decisions
Authentication will initially leverage Gmail to streamline user identity verification.
The initial focus will be on building a web-based platform before considering mobile applications due to development and resource challenges.
The primary components for development are user registration, trip profile creation, and search functionalities.
The communication feature will initially not retain in-app messaging to reduce responsibility and associated costs.
Core milestones and sprint timelines emphasized, targeting a functional initial version by April.
Notes and Observations
An interactive session took place discussing the potential components and functionalities of a travel companion platform.
The platform aims to connect travellers with companions and local experts, enhancing travel experiences.
Discussions revolved around core requirements like account setup, profile details, and trip planning.
Automatic profile linking and verification processes were addressed, balancing user convenience and safety.
The need for a sophisticated search function supporting various filters is explained.
A lean approach to feature development using scalable and modular design principles is encouraged.
Future business considerations such as monetization strategies and expansion plans mentioned.
Emphasis is placed on early and consistent communication among team members to streamline progress.
The meeting concluded with a focus on preparing for the phased delivery of the product using agile methodologies.
